To ensure fair usage and maintain service quality, the Beyond API implements rate limiting on all endpoints.

## Current Limits

### Free Tier
- **Limit**: 100 requests per 15-minute window
- **Scope**: Applied per API key or IP address
- **Reset**: Limits automatically reset after the 15-minute window

## Rate Limit Headers

Rate limit information is included in the response headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Total requests allowed in the window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets

## Rate Limit Exceeded

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a 429 Too Many Requests response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later.",
    "code": 429
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Monitor your usage through rate limit headers
- Cache responses when possible to reduce API calls
- Consider request batching for bulk operations

## Coming Soon

A paid tier with USDC payments is in development, which will offer:
- Higher rate limits
- Priority access
- Additional features

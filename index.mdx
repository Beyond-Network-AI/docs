## About

### Overview

Welcome to the official documentation for Beyond Network: AI Inference Network Powering Autonomous Agents.

## Introduction

### Empowering Developers with Choice and Transparency

Beyond Network revolutionizes AI inference, providing developers with choice and transparency. The platform integrates open-source SOTA models and centralized services. Select the optimal approach for your use case - cost-efficiency via distributed inference or speed with centralized solutions.

### OnChain Payments

Beyond Network provides secure, transparent, efficient onchain payments for AI inference. Eliminates managing multiple API keys and vendors. Pay directly onchain with crypto.

### Autonomous Agents Potential

Beyond Network empowers autonomous agents to access and pay for compute through built-in wallets independently. Agents interact with Beyond Network via smart contracts—endless possibilities for autonomous agent development.

### Inference Verifiability and Onchain Proofs

Beyond Network ensures trust and transparency. Verify inference integrity with onchain proofs.

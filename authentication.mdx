The Beyond API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You need to include your API key in all API requests to our server.

## <Icon icon="lock" iconType="solid" /> API Key Header

Include your API key in the request headers using:

```http
x-api-key: your-api-key
```

## <Icon icon="user-plus" iconType="solid" /> Obtaining an API Key

1. Create an account at [www.beyondnetwork.xyz](https://www.beyondnetwork.xyz)
2. Send an email to contact@beyondnetwork.xyz with your registered email address
3. You will receive your API key via email

## <Icon icon="shield" iconType="solid" /> Security Best Practices

- Keep your API key secure and confidential
- Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories
- Use environment variables to store your API key
- Rotate your API key if you suspect it has been compromised

If authentication fails, you may receive one of these errors:

- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing API key
- **403 Forbidden**: Invalid API key

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Missing API key in request headers",
    "code": 401
  }
}
```

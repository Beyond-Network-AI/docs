## Content-Type Header

Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` for all requests to ensure the server correctly interprets the request payload.

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Why It's Required

- Ensures proper parsing of request bodies
- Enables correct interpretation of JSON payloads
- Prevents data format mismatches

### Request Examples

#### Correct Usage

```http
POST /api/chat/completions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello!"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Common Errors

If the Content-Type header is missing or incorrect, you'll receive a `400 Bad Request` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Content-Type must be application/json",
    "code": 400
  }
}
```

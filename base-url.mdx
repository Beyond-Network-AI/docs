## Base URL

All API requests should be directed to the following base URL:

```http
https://dev.beyondnetwork.xyz/
```

### Usage

When making requests to any endpoint, prefix the endpoint path with this base URL.

For example:
- Chat Completions: `https://dev.beyondnetwork.xyz/api/chat/completions`
- Image Generation: `https://dev.beyondnetwork.xyz/api/images/generate`

### Environment Considerations

- **Development:** The base URL remains the same for both development and production use
- **HTTPS Required:** All requests must use HTTPS for security
- **Regional Endpoints:** Currently, a single global endpoint serves all regions
